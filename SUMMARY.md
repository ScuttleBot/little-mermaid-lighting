# Little Mermaid Lighting Design Research - Summary

## 🔗 Live Presentation

## Key Findings

### 1. Water Caustic Effects (Most Important)
**Professional Technique (Disney 2023 film):**
- Suspended water trays above lights with stirring apparatus
- Creates organic, photorealistic caustic patterns

**High School Options:**
- **Easiest:** 2x Chauvet Abyss USB water effect lights ($400-500 each)
- **Most versatile:** Moving lights with dual gobo wheels + rotation
- **Budget:** 4x Source4 + TwinSpins + water ripple gobos

### 2. Color Palette by Location
**Different scenes need different color identities:**

- **Ariel's Grotto:** Light blues, turquoise (hopeful, curious)
- **Triton's Kingdom:** Jewel tones - blues, purples, teals (regal, vibrant)
- **Ursula's Lair:** Dark purples, deep blues (sinister, shadowy)
- **Above Water:** Warm whites, ambers, golden (realistic, sunlit)

### 3. Lighting Principles for Underwater
- **Backlight + toplight dominance** in blues/teals (water overhead feeling)
- **Warm front/side light** (ambers, light pinks) to pull actors out of blue
- **Common mistake:** Over-saturating with blue wash - "less is more"
- **Movement is key:** Slow gobo rotation, varying speeds between fixtures

### 4. Fog for Water/Land Transitions
**Technique:**
- Dense low fog at deck level = water surface
- Backlit for ethereal boundary
- Gradual lighting shift (cool → warm) over 30-60 seconds
- Fog dissipates upward as character "rises"

**Critical:** Rehearse extensively - timing varies with humidity/HVAC

### 5. The "Sunken Theater" Concept
From ABC Little Mermaid Live! production designer:
- Entire environment feels submerged
- Organic curved shapes (no hard edges)
- Layered effects: projection + LED + practical + lighting
- Constant vertical movement creates "floating" feeling

## Minimum Budget Setup
**Starting from scratch: $800-1500**

Essential equipment:
- 2x water effect lights OR 4x Source4 + TwinSpins + gobos
- 1x low fog machine
- Blue/teal/purple gels
- Warm accent gels (CTOs, light pinks)

## Gobo Recommendations
- **GAM Products water effect recipe book** (get this!)
- Rosco ripple patterns
- Layer multiple gobos at different speeds
- Slow rotation = gentle, natural movement

## Resources
- **Theatre FX:** theatrefx.com (equipment, effects)
- **Matt Kizer Design:** scenicandlighting.com (projection rental $600)
- **GAM/Rosco:** Gobo catalogs and effect recipes
- **Reddit:** r/lightingdesign for community advice

## Next Steps
1. Inventory existing equipment (moving lights? Conventional? DMX control?)
2. Decide budget allocation (rent vs. buy)
3. Test water effect options in actual space
4. Practice fog timing during tech rehearsals
5. Create scene-by-scene lighting plot based on color palettes

## Scene-Specific Notes

**"Part of Your World"** - Lighter blues, intimate yet grand, warm light on human objects

**"Under the Sea"** - High energy, oranges/pinks, brightest scene, constant movement

**"Kiss the Girl"** - Above water, romantic moonlight, dappled tree shadows

**"Poor Unfortunate Souls"** - Darkest scene, deep purples, dramatic shadows, smoke/haze
